This library dispatches a task defined by some data on a callable, or with the
appropriated vocabulary, on a controller and an action. It is often used in
conjunction with the [`Hoa\Router`
library](https://central.hoa-project.net/Resource/Library/Router) and the
[`Hoa\View` library](https://central.hoa-project.net/Resource/Library/View).

The link between libraries and the application is represented by a kit which
aggregates all important data, such as the dispatcher, the router, the view and
data associated to the view.

## Installation

With [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/), to include this library into
your dependencies, you need to
require [`hoa/dispatcher`](https://packagist.org/packages/hoa/dispatcher):

```sh
$ composer require hoa/dispatcher '~1.0'
```

For more installation procedures, please read [the Source
page](https://hoa-project.net/Source.html).

## Testing

Before running the test suites, the development dependencies must be installed:

```sh
$ composer install
```

Then, to run all the test suites:

```sh
$ vendor/bin/hoa test:run
```

For more information, please read the [contributor
guide](https://hoa-project.net/Literature/Contributor/Guide.html).

## Quick usage

We propose a quick overview of the basic dispatcher represented by the class
`Hoa\Dispatcher\Basic` which is able to dispatch a task on three kinds of
callables:

  * lambda function (as a controller, no action);
  * function (as a controller, no action);
  * class and method (respectively as a controller and an action).

We will focus on the last kind with this following example:

```php
$router = new Hoa\Router\Http();
$router->get('w', '/(?<controller>[^/]+)/(?<action>\w+)\.html');

$dispatcher = new Hoa\Dispatcher\Basic();
$dispatcher->dispatch($router);
```

By default, the controller will be `Application\Controller\<Controller>` and the
action will be `<Action>Action`. Thus, for the request `/Foo/Bar.html`, we will
call `Application\Controller\Foo::BarAction`.

It is possible to specify a different controller and action names if the request
is asynchronous. By default, only the action name is different with the value
`<Action>ActionAsync`.

With all kinds of callables, the basic dispatcher will distribute captured data
(with the `(?<name>â€¦)` [PCRE](https://pcre.org/) syntax) on callable arguments
where the `name` matches the argument name. For example, with a rule such as
`'/hello_(?<nick>\w+)'`, if the callable has an argument named `$nick`, it will
receive the value `gordon` for the request `/hello_gordon`.

The kit is reachable through the `$_this` argument or `$this` variable if the
controller is a class that extends `Hoa\Dispatcher\Kit`. The kit propose four
elementary attributes, which are: `router`, `dispatcher`, `view` and `data`.

## Documentation

The
[hack book of `Hoa\Dispatcher`](https://central.hoa-project.net/Documentation/Library/Dispatcher)
contains detailed information about how to use this library and how it works.

To generate the documentation locally, execute the following commands:

```sh
$ composer require --dev hoa/devtools
$ vendor/bin/hoa devtools:documentation --open
```

More documentation can be found on the project's website:
