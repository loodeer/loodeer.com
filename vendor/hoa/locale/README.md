This library allows to get the informations of the locale from the system, the
HTTP client or something else.

[Learn more](https://central.hoa-project.net/Documentation/Library/Locale).

## Installation

With [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/), to include this library into
your dependencies, you need to
require [`hoa/locale`](https://packagist.org/packages/hoa/locale):

```sh
$ composer require hoa/locale '~2.0'
```

For more installation procedures, please read [the Source
page](https://hoa-project.net/Source.html).

## Testing

Before running the test suites, the development dependencies must be installed:

```sh
$ composer install
```

Then, to run all the test suites:

```sh
$ vendor/bin/hoa test:run
```

For more information, please read the [contributor
guide](https://hoa-project.net/Literature/Contributor/Guide.html).

## Quick usage

We propose a quick overview to get the locale and related informations about an
HTTP client. Next, we will see the other localizers.

### Locale from an HTTP client

To get the locale from an HTTP client, we will use the
`Hoa\Locale\Localizer\Http` localizer. Then, we will print the result of the
following interesting methods:

  * `getLanguage` to get the language,
  * `getScript` to get the script,
  * `getRegion` to get the region,
  * `getVariants` to get variants of the locale.

Thus:

```php
$locale = new Hoa\Locale(new Hoa\Locale\Localizer\Http());

echo
    'language : ', $locale->getLanguage(), "\n",
    'script   : ', $locale->getScript(), "\n",
    'region   : ', $locale->getRegion(), "\n",
    'variant  : ', implode(', ', $locale->getVariants()), "\n";
```

For example, with the `Accept-Language` HTTP header set to
`zh-Hant-TW-xy-ab-123`, we will have:

```
language : zh
script   : Hant
region   : TW
variant  : xy, ab, 123
```

### Other localizers

So far, we also have the `Hoa\Locale\Localizer\System` to get the locale
informations from the system and `Hoa\Locale\Localizer\Coerce` to get them from
an arbitrary locale representation.

## Documentation

The
[hack book of `Hoa\Locale`](https://central.hoa-project.net/Documentation/Library/Locale)
contains detailed information about how to use this library and how it works.

To generate the documentation locally, execute the following commands:

```sh
$ composer require --dev hoa/devtools
$ vendor/bin/hoa devtools:documentation --open
```

More documentation can be found on the project's website:
[hoa-project.net](https://hoa-project.net/).
