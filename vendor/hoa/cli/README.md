This meta-library provides the `hoa` command line. This is a shell tool to
access libraries' commands.

[Learn more](https://central.hoa-project.net/Documentation/Library/Cli).

## Installation

With [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/), to include this library into
your dependencies, you need to
require [`hoa/cli`](https://packagist.org/packages/hoa/cli):

```sh
$ composer require hoa/cli '~2.0'
```

For more installation procedures, please read [the Source
page](https://hoa-project.net/Source.html).

## Testing

Before running the test suites, the development dependencies must be installed:

```sh
$ composer install
```

Then, to run all the test suites:

```sh
$ vendor/bin/hoa test:run
```

For more information, please read the [contributor
guide](https://hoa-project.net/Literature/Contributor/Guide.html).

## Quick usage

Once installed, commands from libraries can be run with the following command
line pattern:

```sh
$ hoa <library-name>:<command-name> <options> <inputs>
```

Running `hoa` with no argument will list all the available commands with a small
description. Note: If the option `--no-verbose` is present, the list of commands
will not be formatted. Thus, used in conjunction with [Zsh
resources](https://central.hoa-project.net/Resource/Contributions/Zsh/Hoa), you
will be able to auto-complete any commands from any libraries for free.

On every command, there is at least the `-h`, `--help` and `-?` options,
providing helps and usages.

To provide a command from a library, create a class inside the `Bin/` directory.
For instance, for a potential `Hoa\Foo` library, the `bar` command will be
described by the `Hoa\Foo\Bin\Bar` class, located inside the `Foo/Bin/Bar.php`
file.

## Documentation

The
[hack book of `Hoa\Cli`](https://central.hoa-project.net/Documentation/Library/Cli)
contains detailed information about how to use this library and how it works.

To generate the documentation locally, execute the following commands:

```sh
$ composer require --dev hoa/devtools
$ vendor/bin/hoa devtools:documentation --open
```

More documentation can be found on the project's website:
[hoa-project.net](https://hoa-project.net/).
